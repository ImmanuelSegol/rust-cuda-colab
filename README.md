# Running CUDA and rust using Google Colab

The aim of the notebook is to be able to compile a rust+cuda library in the Google Colab environment using its free GPUs.

The notebook is self-contained and provides all the instructions to compile and test the icicle library.

Moreover, instructions on how to develop CUDA in that environment are also included.

Just download it, open it in Google Colab, and enjoy!
